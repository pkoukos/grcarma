<h2><a name="section_3">I hate manuals</a></h2>

<p>
Tell me about it. Anyway, here is a quick tutorial for the impatient: go to 
a GNU/linux box, open a unix shell, install the program, create a clean 
directory containing your DCD and PSF files and make this your working 
directory. From now on, I will assume for simplicity that you DCD-PSF system 
contains one polypeptide chain with a segment identifier equal to "A", 
plenty of water molecules, and some sodium and chloride ions. For the 
purpose of this tutorial, grab also a copy of your protein-only PSF file 
(ie. a PSF file containing only the protein atoms as produced, for example, 
from PSFGEN). To make things go fast for this tutorial, don't start with 
your brand new 90 Gbytes - 100,000 atoms DCD file (but you do need a 
sufficiently large number of frames for the statistical analyses to be 
meaningful). 
<p>
<h4><a name="section_4">Quick view of trajectories</a></h4>

<p>
To start with, let's have a quick look at the trajectory to make sure 
everything looks OK: 
<p>
<strong>carma my.dcd my.psf</strong>
<p>
and press ENTER a couple of times. When you had enough, make the shell 
window active again and stop the program with CTRL-C. If you haven't had enough, 
see the section entitled <strong>Graphics tricks and examples</strong>.
<p>
<h4><a name="section_5">RMSD matrix</a></h4>

<p>
Good, now that you had enough, let's calculate something useful: 
<p>
The aim is to produce a matrix containing the rms deviations (using CA atoms 
only) between all possible pairs of structures from your trajectory. The 
problem is that if your trajectory contains, say, 100,000 frames, then your 
matrix will end-up being a &nbsp;38 GBytes file which -even if you can calculate 
it- will be useless for any further analysis. So, instead of using each and 
every frame, use every, say, 500th structure to reduce its size: 
<p>
<strong>carma -verbose -cross -step 500 -segid A my.dcd my.psf</strong>
<p>
A new file will be produced in your current directory named 
<strong>carma.RMSD.matrix</strong>
which contains the matrix. Prepare a colour 
postscript representation of the matrix with 
<p>
<strong>carma -colour - < carma.RMSD.matrix</strong>
<p>
and view the resulting <strong>carma.stdin.ps</strong>
file with your favorite 
postscript viewer. The color gradient goes from dark blue (for small 
values), through yellow (for medium values), to dark red (for large values), 
with the origin at the upper left-hand corner. 
<p>
<h4><a name="section_6">Dihedral PCA</a></h4>

<p>
Let's move-on to principal component analysis: 
<p>
<strong>carma -verbose -write -color -segid A -dPCA 5 3 298 my.dcd my.psf</strong>
<p>
This will do a dihedral angle (phi,psi) principal component analysis of your 
protein's trajectory. Because dPCA uses internal coordinates, there is no 
need to remove overall translations and rotations from beforehand. The 
three numbers following the <strong>-dPCA</strong>
flag are the important ones: '5' 
is the number of principal components which will be written to a file (in 
the current directory) named <strong>carma.dPCA.fluctuations.dat</strong>,
'3' is 
the number of principal components for which DeltaG (energy landscapes) 
postscript diagrams will be produced, and finally, '298' is the temperature 
of your simulation in Kelvin. If you list the directory contents (after 
carma is finished) you should see quite a number of files: 
<p>
<pre>
 carma.clusters.dat              carma.dPCA.eigenvalues.dat      
 carma.dPCA.DG_01_02.dat         carma.dPCA.eigenvectors.dat     
 carma.dPCA.DG_01_02.ps          carma.dPCA.fluctuations.dat     
 carma.dPCA.DG_01_03.dat         my.dcd                          
 carma.dPCA.DG_01_03.ps          my.dcd.dPCA.varcov.dat          
 carma.dPCA.DG_02_03.dat         my.dcd.dPCA.varcov.ps           
 carma.dPCA.DG_02_03.ps          my.psf                          
</pre>
<p>
<strong>my.psf</strong>
and <strong>my.dcd</strong>
are where we started from, 
<strong>carma.dPCA.eigenvalues.dat</strong>
and <strong>carma.dPCA.eigenvectors.dat</strong>
are exactly what you think they are (eigenvectors are in columns, top-first), 
<strong>carma.dPCA.fluctuations.dat</strong>
has already been described, 
<strong>my.dcd.dPCA.varcov.dat</strong>
and <strong>my.dcd.dPCA.varcov.ps</strong>
are the 
variance-covariance matrix and corresponding postscript plot, and finally, 
the various <strong>carma.dPCA.DG_*</strong>
files are the data and postscript plots 
of the free energy landscapes on the principal component planes defined by 
the eigenvectors pairs 1-2, 1-3 and 2-3. Use your postscript viewer to 
examine the images, use your plotting program (xmgr, gnuplot, grace, ...) 
to examine the data files, etc. 
<p>
If you want to include the side-chains' chi1 angles in the analysis, repeat 
the calculation this time adding the <strong>-chi1</strong>
flag in the command 
line. 
<p>
<h4><a name="section_7">Dihedral-PCA-based cluster analysis</a></h4>

<p>
The file <strong>carma.clusters.dat</strong>
contains the results from a cluster 
analysis performed using the top three principal components and is described 
in detail in the section entitled <strong>PCA-based cluster analysis</strong>.
Here we will only deal with the practical part. We start by examining 
how well (or otherwise) the cluster analysis went: use awk to isolate the frames 
that carma thinks that belong to the most populated cluster (corresponding, 
hopefully, to the major conformer): 
<p>
<pre>
awk '{if ($2==1) print $1,$3,$4,$5}' carma.clusters.dat &gt; C_01.dat
</pre>
<p>
and use your plotting program to make a scatter plot of the 2nd and 3rd columns 
of the <strong>carma.dPCA.fluctuations.dat</strong>
file and <strong>superimpose</strong>
on 
this (using a different colour) a scatter plot of the 2nd and 3rd columns of 
the <strong>C_01.dat</strong>
file. If all went well you should see the second plot 
overlapping the most prominent cluster of the first plot. 
<p>
<h4><a name="section_8">dPCA clusters: fitting, covariance matrices &amp; average structures</a></h4>

<p>
We know the trajectory frames that constitute the core of the largest 
cluster, but this is not enough. Let's examine this cluster in more detail: 
first prepare a new DCD file containing just the frames corresponding to 
this cluster (note that the various carma flags can be shortened to their 
uniquely identifiable minimum): 
<p>
<strong>carma -v -sort C_01.dat my.dcd</strong>
<p>
The new DCD file is named <strong>carma.reordered.dcd</strong>.
To calculate an 
average structure, we must remove overall rotations and translations. While 
we do this, we might as well get rid of all those waters and ions and keep 
just the protein atoms: 
<p>
<strong>carma -v -w -fit -atmid ALLID -segid A carma.reordered.dcd my.psf</strong>
<p>
The resulting DCD file is named <strong>carma.fitted.dcd</strong>
and contains the 
coordinates of the protein component only, for the first cluster only, and 
with overall rotations and translations removed. As a bonus you also get a 
file named <strong>carma.fit-rms.dat</strong>
containing (in its second column) the 
rms deviation of each frame from the first frame (you can of course use your 
plotting program to see the corresponding graph). Confirm that everything 
looks OK and rename the DCD file to something more useful: 
<p>
<strong>carma carma.fitted.dcd protein.psf</strong>
<pre>
mv carma.fitted.dcd cluster_01.dcd
</pre>
<p>
where <strong>protein.psf</strong>
is the PSF file of the protein component only (as 
produced, for example, from PSFGEN). We can now calculate the normalised 
variance-covariance matrix and the average structure in the form of a PDB 
file, plus a PDB file containing a superposition of representative 
structures belonging to this cluster. The following line will do the trick: 
<p>
<strong>carma -v -w -col -cov -dot -super -atmid HEAVY cluster_01.dcd protein.psf</strong>
<p>
Use your postscript viewer to look at the covariance matrix in the file 
<strong>cluster_01.dcd.varcov.ps</strong>
and your favorite molecular graphics 
program to see the structures in the files <strong>carma.superposition.pdb</strong>
and 
<strong>carma.average.pdb</strong>.
Use your plotting program to view the rms 
deviations from this average structure as contained in the file 
<strong>carma.rms-average.dat</strong>.
Since you are here, a possibly more useful 
covariance matrix to look at, is the normalised per residue (in reality, per 
CA) map: 
<p>
<strong>carma -v -w -col -cov -dot -norm cluster_01.dcd protein.psf</strong>
<p>
(note that the new average structure produced by the program will this time 
contain only CA atoms). Because <strong>carma</strong>'s
default is to use to CA 
atoms, there is no need to say <strong>-atmid CA</strong>
as you might have 
expected. 
<p>
<h4><a name="section_9">Fitting, removal of waters and ions</a></h4>

<p>
Enough with dihedral PCA, let's start with Cartesian PCA: delete (or copy 
and then delete) everything but the files my.dcd, my.psf and protein.psf, 
and then give: 
<p>
<strong>carma -v -w -fit -atmid ALLID -segid A my.dcd my.psf</strong>
<pre>
mv carma.fitted.dcd protein.dcd
</pre>
<p>
The line above will superimpose all atoms of segid A of each and every frame 
on the first frame of the trajectory and will produce a new DCD file name 
<strong>carma.fitted.dcd</strong>
containing the coordinates (of only all atoms of 
segid A, no waters or ions) with rotations and translations removed. You 
will also get a file named <strong>carma.fit-rms.dat</strong>
containing in its 
first two columns the rms deviation from the reference structure vs. frame 
number [the rest of the columns in the carma.fit-rms.dat file are the 
rotation matrix (9 columns) and the translation vector (3 columns)]. If you 
want to use a different reference frame, use the <strong>-reference</strong>
flag. 
If you want to use selected atoms for fitting, see the flag <strong>-index</strong>.
<p>
<h4><a name="section_10">Cartesian PCA</a></h4>

<p>
Now that we have removed rotations and translations, we can go ahead with 
cartesian PCA. Before that, however, go to the section entitled 
<strong>Appendix: Preparation of CA-only PSF files</strong>
and prepare a file named 
CAs.psf for the CA-only atoms of your protein (the reason for using only the 
CA atoms for the this section is to keep matrices' sizes reasonably small). 
Now do: 
<p>
<strong>carma -v -w -col -cov -eigen -proj 5 3 298 protein.dcd protein.psf</strong>
<p>
where <strong>protein.psf</strong>
is the PSF file of the protein component only (as 
produced, for example, from PSFGEN). The line above will do a cartesian 
principal component analysis of your protein's trajectory <strong>using only the CA atoms</strong>.
If you would rather use, say, all non-hydrogen atoms (and have enough CPU 
time to spare), add an <strong>-atmid</strong>
flag in the spirit of e.g. '-atmid HEAVY'. 
The three numbers following the <strong>-proj</strong>
flag have the following 
meaning: '5' is the number of principal components which will be written to 
a file (in the current directory) named <strong>carma.PCA.fluctuations.dat</strong>,
'3' is the number of principal components for which DeltaG (energy 
landscapes) postscript diagrams will be produced, and finally, '298' is the 
temperature of your simulation in Kelvin. If you list the directory contents 
you will something like this: 
<p>
<pre>
carma.PCA.DG_01_02.dat		carma.PCA.fluctuations.dat
carma.PCA.DG_01_02.ps		carma.clusters.dat
carma.PCA.DG_01_03.dat		carma.fit-rms.dat
carma.PCA.DG_01_03.ps		protein.dcd
carma.PCA.DG_02_03.dat		protein.dcd.varcov.dat
carma.PCA.DG_02_03.ps		protein.dcd.varcov.ps
my.dcd					carma.PCA.eigenvalues.dat
my.psf					carma.PCA.eigenvectors.dat
protein.psf				CAs.psf
</pre>
<p>
<strong>my.psf</strong>,
<strong>my.dcd</strong>,
<strong>protein.psf</strong>
and <strong>CAs.psf</strong>
are where we started from, <strong>carma.PCA.eigenvalues.dat</strong>
and 
<strong>carma.PCA.eigenvectors.dat</strong>
are exactly what you think they are 
(eigenvectors are in columns, top-first), 
<strong>carma.PCA.fluctuations.dat</strong>
has already been described, 
<strong>protein.dcd.varcov.dat</strong>
and <strong>protein.dcd.varcov.ps</strong>
are the 
variance-covariance matrix and corresponding postscript plot, and finally, 
the various <strong>carma.PCA.DG_*</strong>
files are the data and postscript plots 
of the free energy landscapes on the principal component planes defined by 
the eigenvectors pairs 1-2, 1-3 and 2-3. Use your postscript viewer to 
examine the images, use your plotting program (xmgr, gnuplot, grace, ...) to 
examine the data files, etc. 
<p>
<h4><a name="section_11">Cartesian-PCA-based cluster analysis</a></h4>

<p>
This is more-or-less identical with the dPCA cluster analysis: 
The file <strong>carma.clusters.dat</strong>
contains the results from a cluster 
analysis performed using the top three principal components and is described 
in detail in the section entitled <strong>PCA-based cluster analysis</strong>.
Here we will only deal with the practical part. Start by examining 
how well (or otherwise) the cluster analysis went: use awk to isolate the frames 
that carma thinks that belong to the most populated cluster (corresponding, 
hopefully, to the major conformer): 
<p>
<pre>
awk '{if ($2==1) print $1,$3,$4,$5}' carma.clusters.dat &gt; C_01.dat
</pre>
<p>
and use your plotting program to make a scatter plot of the 2nd and 3rd columns 
of the <strong>carma.PCA.fluctuations.dat</strong>
file and <strong>superimpose</strong>
on 
this (using a different colour) a scatter plot of the 2nd and 3rd columns of 
the <strong>C_01.dat</strong>
file. If all went well you should see the second plot 
overlapping the most prominent cluster of the first plot. 
<p>
<h4><a name="section_12">Cartesian PCA clusters: fitting, covariance matrices &amp; average structures</a></h4>

<p>
We know the trajectory frames that constitute the core of the largest 
cluster, but this is not enough. Let's examine this cluster in more detail: 
first prepare a new DCD file containing just the frames corresponding to 
this cluster: 
<p>
<strong>carma -v -sort C_01.dat protein.dcd</strong>
<p>
The new DCD file is named <strong>carma.reordered.dcd</strong>.
Although the protein.dcd file 
has rotations and translations removed, it is probably safer to re-align all 
cluster frames once more (using again only CA atoms): 
<p>
<strong>carma -v -w -fit -segid A carma.reordered.dcd protein.psf</strong>
<p>
The resulting DCD file is named <strong>carma.fitted.dcd</strong>
and contains the 
coordinates of only the CA atoms of the protein component, for the first cluster only, and 
with overall rotations and translations removed. As a bonus you also get a 
file named <strong>carma.fit-rms.dat</strong>
containing (in its second column) the 
rms deviation of each frame from the first frame (you can of course use your 
plotting program to see the corresponding graph). Confirm that everything 
looks OK and rename the DCD file to something more relevant: 
<p>
<strong>carma carma.fitted.dcd CAs.psf</strong>
<pre>
mv carma.fitted.dcd cluster_01.dcd
</pre>
<p>
where <strong>CAs.psf</strong>
is the PSF file of the CA atoms of the protein component 
(see section <strong>Appendix: Preparation of CA-only PSF files</strong>
for 
guidance in producing such a PSF file). We can now calculate the normalised 
variance-covariance matrix and the average structure in the form of a PDB 
file, plus a PDB file containing a superposition of representative 
structures belonging to this cluster. The following lines will do the trick: 
<p>
<strong>carma -v -w -col -cov -dot -super cluster_01.dcd CAs.psf</strong>
<p>
Use your postscript viewer to look at the covariance matrix in the file 
<strong>cluster_01.dcd.varcov.ps</strong>
and your favorite molecular graphics 
program to see the structures in the files <strong>carma.superposition.pdb</strong>
and <strong>carma.average.pdb</strong>
(which will contain the CA atoms only). Use your 
plotting program to view the rms deviations from this average structure as 
contained in the file <strong>carma.rms-average.dat</strong>.
Since you are here, a 
possibly more useful covariance matrix to look at, is the normalised per 
residue (in reality, per CA) map: 
<p>
<strong>carma -v -w -col -cov -dot -norm cluster_01.dcd CAs.psf</strong>
<p>
<h4><a name="section_13">'Seeing' the motion corresponding to a selected principal component</a></h4>

<p>
Do a 'more carma.PCA.DG_01_02.ps' and note the limits of the plot 
reported (as a comment) in the header of the postscript file. 
Then using the image <strong>carma.PCA.DG_01_02.ps</strong>
and these 
limits, determine the minimum and maximum observed values of the first 
principal component. If you hate using rulers and pens, use awk: 
<p>
<pre>
awk '{print $2}' carma.PCA.fluctuations.dat | sort -n | tail -1
awk '{print $2}' carma.PCA.fluctuations.dat | sort -n | head -1
</pre>
<p>
Now, use these two numbers to run <strong>carma</strong>
(this example again assumes 
that you only care about the CA atoms): 
<p>
<strong>carma -verb -write -col -cov -eigen -play 1 -4 5 cluster_01.dcd CAs.psf</strong>
<p>
where the numbers '-4' and '5' are those you determined from the awk lines 
above. A new DCD file has been produced named <strong>carma.play.dcd</strong>.
Play 
it using for example VMD (vmd carma.play.dcd CAs.psf) or carma (carma 
carma.play.dcd CAs.psf). Finally, prepare a PDB file showing the motion due to the 
first eigenvector: 
<p>
<strong>carma -v -w -pdb -last 10000 -step 500 carma.play.dcd CAs.psf</strong>
<pre>
cat carma.play.dcd.*.pdb &gt; eigen_01.pdb
rm carma.play.dcd.*.pdb
</pre>
<p>
where the number after -last (10000 in this example) is one half of the 
total number of frames in the carma.play.dcd file. 
<p>
<h4><a name="section_14">Solute entropy calculation</a></h4>

<p>
Delete (or copy and then delete) everything but the files my.dcd, my.psf, protein.psf 
and CAs.psf. Then, remove rotations-translations 
<p>
<strong>carma -v -fit -atmid ALLID -segid A my.dcd my.psf</strong>
<p>
and start calculating entropies using, for example, increasing number of frames 
(the number '320' next to '-temp' is the simulation's temperature in Kelvin) : 
<p>
<strong>carma -v -cov -eigen -mass -temp 320 -atmid ALLID -segid A -last 1000 carma.fitted.dcd protein.psf</strong>
<p>
<strong>carma -v -cov -eigen -mass -temp 320 -atmid ALLID -segid A -last 2000 carma.fitted.dcd protein.psf</strong>
<p>
<strong>carma -v -cov -eigen -mass -temp 320 -atmid ALLID -segid A -last 3000 carma.fitted.dcd protein.psf</strong>
<p>
<strong>...</strong>
<p>
<h4><a name="section_15">Per frame distance maps</a></h4>

<p>
To calculate coloured CA-CA distance maps for the structures corresponding 
to frames 1, 1001, 2001, ..., give: 
<p>
<strong>carma -v -w -col -step 1000 my.dcd my.psf</strong>
<p>
keeping in mind that, depending on the number of frames you have, this may 
produce quite a number of files. If you want distance maps for all 
non-hydrogen atoms you will have to define both -atmid &amp; -segid (otherwise 
you'll pick-up all water oxygens as well): 
<p>
<strong>carma -v -w -col -atmid HEAVY -segid A -step 5000 my.dcd my.psf</strong>
<p>
<h4><a name="section_16">Average distance maps &amp; rms deviation from them</a></h4>

<p>
Calculate (i) the average distance map for all non-hydrogen atoms, and, (ii) a map 
depicting the rms deviation of these distances from their average: 
<p>
<strong>carma -v -w -col -rms -atmid HEAVY -segid A my.dcd my.psf</strong>
<p>
View the postscript files <strong>my.dcd.averag.ps</strong>
and 
<strong>my.dcd.rmsdev.ps</strong>,
and then merge them about their diagonal: 
<p>
<strong>carma my.dcd.averag.ps my.dcd.rmsdev.ps</strong>
<p>
You now have a new postscript file named <strong>carma.merged.ps</strong>
which 
contains one half from the average distance map, the other half from the 
rmsd map. 
<p>
Similarly, say that you want to compare the rms deviations of the average 
CA-CA distance maps between the first and the second half of the trajectory 
(assumed to have 40000 frames). Here it is: 
<p>
<pre>
carma -v -w -col -rms -mrms 4 -last 20000 my.dcd my.psf
mv my.dcd.rmsdev.ps 1.ps
carma -v -w -col -rms -mrms 4 -first 20001 my.dcd my.psf
mv my.dcd.rmsdev.ps 2.ps
carma 1.ps 2.ps
</pre>
<p>
and then view the results in the postscript file <strong>carma.merged.ps</strong>
(the <strong>-mrms</strong>
flag in the previous lines has been added to guarantee a 
constant scale between the two graphs). 
<p>
<h4><a name="section_17">Extracting selected PDB files</a></h4>

<p>
Get a series of PDB files containing all atoms of segid A for the frames 1, 
1001, 2001, ... : 
<p>
<strong>carma -v -pdb -atmid ALLID -segid A -step 1000 my.dcd my.psf</strong>
<p>
This will produce a series of PDB files of the form 
<strong>my.dcd.??????.pdb)</strong>
where the question marks are substituted by the 
corresponding frame number. Please see section <strong>Bugs &amp; features</strong>
for 
an important feature concerning atom names and segment identifiers. 
<p>
If you need a specific frame, the following line should do it: 
<p>
<strong>carma -v -pdb -atmid ALLID -segid A -first 16384 -last 16384 my.dcd my.psf</strong>
<p>
<h4><a name="section_18">Radius of gyration, distances angles &amp; torsions</a></h4>

<p>
Calculate the mass-weighted radius of gyration of segid A, and place the 
results in the file <strong>carma.Rgyration.dat</strong>:
<p>
<strong>carma -v -rg -atmid ALLID -segid A my.dcd my.psf</strong>
<p>
Calculate the distance between the 3rd and the 48th atom (the atom numbers 
being those reported in the PSF file) and place the results in the file 
<strong>carma.distances</strong>:
<p>
<strong>carma -v -dist 3 48 -atmid ALLID my.dcd my.psf</strong>
<p>
Calculate the torsion angle (in the range -180 to +180 degrees) defined by 
the atoms 12, 34, 52 and 98, and place the results in the file 
<strong>carma.torsions</strong>:
<p>
<strong>carma -v -torsion 12 34 52 98 -atmid ALLID my.dcd my.psf</strong>
<p>
Calculate the bending angle (in the range 0 to 180 degrees) defined by the 
atoms 23, 36 and 48, and place the results in the file 
<strong>carma.bendangles</strong>:
<p>
<strong>carma -v -bend 23 36 48 -atmid ALLID my.dcd my.psf</strong>
<p>
<h2><a name="section_19">Description</a></h2>

<p>
<strong>Carma</strong>
is light-weight command-line-driven molecular dynamics analysis 
program for DCD-type trajectory files. <strong>Carma</strong>
started as a CA-CA 
distance map calculator, but ended supporting most of the steps required for 
a principal component analysis of molecular dynamics trajectories (also 
known as essential dynamics analysis). In recent versions it also acquired 
the ability to display (on X11-capable machines) a trajectory. Nevertheless, 
the initial features of the program are still there and so you can still use 
the program for something as simple as making a postscript file containing a 
grayscale image of the CA-CA distance map of your protein. This mixing of 
seemingly uncorrelated calculations does have its cost : it is almost 
impossible to remember what combination of keywords will do what (which, 
reassuringly, is the case with most unix commands). 
<p>
<strong>For the discussion that follows I will be referring to the CA atoms only of</strong>
<strong>the whole molecule which is the default atom selection for the</strong>
<strong>program. Note, however, that it is possible to</strong>
<strong>select other atom types or SegIDs (SEGment IDentifiers). See</strong>
<strong>keywords -atomid and -segid.</strong>
<p>
<h2><a name="section_20">Compiling the program</a></h2>

<p>
Have a look in the bin/ subdirectory of the distribution (just in case there 
is an executable already available for your machine). 
<p>
To build from source you will need some familiarity with compilers and 
libraries. <strong>Carma</strong>
dependencies are: 
<p>
*&nbsp;&nbsp;For the eigen calculation the LAPACK library is needed (possibly with 
BLAS). 
<p>
*&nbsp;&nbsp;For graphics support you need the Ygl v.4.1 library (google for 
'Ygl'). 
<p>
Compiling the program per se is easy. But linking with the LAPACK 
library may require the usage of a fortran compiler. For example, on a 
GNU/Linux machine&nbsp;: 
<p>
<strong>gcc -DGRA -D_FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64 -Wall -pedantic -O -c carma.c</strong>
<p>
<strong>g77 -DGRA -D_FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64 -Wall -pedantic -O carma.o -L/usr/X11R6/lib -lYgl -lXext -lX11 -llapack -lblas -lm</strong>
<p>
It is possible to avoid the separate link step if you know which libraries 
the fortran compiler needs. For example, on an OSF machine you could use 
something like the following (but please note that I no longer have access 
to an alpha machine, so the following line has not been tested) : 
<p>
<strong>cc -DGRA -newc -fast -arch generic -tune generic carma.c -lYgl -lXext -lX11 -llapack -lblas -lm -lUfor -lfor -lFutil -lm -lots -lc</strong>
<p>
Clearly, this short description isn't very helpful ---and will probably 
fail--- if you are not using a GNU/Linux or OSF machine. Fear not&nbsp;: I hearby 
undertake to help you with your compilation (and/or linking) problems for 
other architectures (excluding windoze for which an executable is already 
available) as long as you agree to provide me with a copy of an executable 
for the next <strong>carma</strong>
version (so that I can include it with the 
distribution). 
<p>
<h2><a name="section_21">General options</a></h2>

<p>
All input to the program is through (case-insensitive) command-line options. 
Abbreviated (but uniquely identifiable) forms of the various flags are also 
valid. 
<p>
<h4><a name="section_22">-verb</a></h4>

<p>
Tells <strong>carma</strong>
to stop being so esoteric about what it is doing. 
<p>
<h4><a name="section_23">-write</a></h4>

<p>
For each and every postscript file written by the program, an additional 
file with the suffix <strong>.dat</strong>
will also be produced. This will contain 
the results of the respective calculation performed. 
<p>
<h4><a name="section_24">-sigma &lt;float&gt;</a></h4>

<p>
Apply a sigmoidal function weighting to all data written out by the program. 
This is intended as a means to increase the contrast of the 
cross-correlation matrices. The function used is 2.0/[1+exp(Sigma*x)] - 1. 
<p>
<h4><a name="section_25">-pdb</a></h4>

<p>
Write-out the selected atoms from the selected frames to a series of PDB 
files. The names of the PDB files are constructed using the name of the DCD 
file plus the frame number. See section <strong>Bugs &amp; features</strong>
for the 
treatment of long atom and segid names. 
<p>
<h2><a name="section_26">Atom, segment and frame selection</a></h2>

<p>
<h4><a name="section_27">-atomid &lt;string&gt;</a></h4>

<p>
<strong>carma</strong>'s
default is to use only the CA atoms for its calculations. 
This option allows the additive selection of other atom types. For, example 
the combination 
<div align=center>
<pre>
-atomid CA  -atomid C  -atomid N  -atomid O
</pre>
</div>
will select the protein backbone atoms. See also the <strong>-segid</strong>
option 
below. You can select all atoms using the special selection 
<div align=center>
<pre>
-atomid ALLID
</pre>
</div>
or, all non-hydrogen atoms using the expression 
<div align=center>
<pre>
-atomid HEAVY
</pre>
</div>
<p>
<h4><a name="section_28">-segid &lt;string&gt;</a></h4>

<p>
<strong>carma</strong>'s
default is to use all segments for its 
calculations. This option allows the additive selection of specific segments 
that should be used. For, example the combination 
<div align=center>
<pre>
-segid A  -segid D  -atomid CB 
</pre>
</div>
will perform subsequent calculations using only the coordinates of the CB 
atoms that belong to the A or D segments. See also the <strong>-atomid</strong>
option 
above. The <strong>-segid</strong>
option is not valid for the PDB-only mode of the 
program. 
<p>
<h4><a name="section_29">-first &lt;positive integer&gt;</a></h4>

<h4><a name="section_30">-last &nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;positive integer&gt;</a></h4>

<h4><a name="section_31">-step &nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;positive integer&gt;</a></h4>

<p>
These three keywords define the DCD frames that will be used for subsequent 
calculations. The default is to use all frames present in the DCD file, 
until the end-of-file is reached (the value for the number of coordinate 
sets which is given in the header of the DCD files is ignored). 
<p>
<strong>carma</strong>
completely ignores the information about timesteps (starting 
and interval) from the DCD header and uses the following reference 
scheme : the first frame contained in the DCD file is frame number 1, the 
second is number 2, and so on until the end of the DCD file. The convention 
for the <strong>-step</strong>
keyword is : If step=1, then each and every frame will 
be used. If step=2 then the first frame will be used, the next skipped, the 
third used, etc. 
<p>
<h4><a name="section_32">-noCAs</a></h4>

<p>
This flag instructs the program to produce DCD files containing coordinates not only 
for the selected atoms, but for all atoms that were present in the input DCD file. 
<strong>Note well : all non-selected atoms will be copied on an 'as-is' basis to the output file</strong>.
The implication is that any all-atom representation calculated on from the 
newly produced DCD file will be meaningless. The only use for this keyword 
(that I can envision) is saving you from producing a PSF file for the atoms 
you selected. In summary, this is a useless and possibly confusing keyword. 
Don't use it. 
<p>
<h2><a name="section_33">Removing rotations - translations</a></h2>

<p>
<h4><a name="section_34">-fit</a></h4>

<p>
In this mode <strong>carma</strong>
will produce two files. The first is a DCD file 
named <strong>carma.fitted.dcd</strong>
which will contain a trajectory with the 
global rotations and translations removed. This is based on the application 
of Kabsch's algorithm to least-squares fit all frames onto the first frame 
(or, through the <strong>-ref</strong>
keyword, a user-defined reference frame). 
Which atoms will be used for the fitting (and will, thus, be contained in 
the DCD) is determined by the <strong>-segid</strong>
and <strong>-atomid</strong>
flags. 
You can explicitly select a subset of those using the <strong>-index</strong>
keyword. 
The second file (<strong>carma.fit-rms.dat</strong>)
is an ASCII file containing (in 
its second column) the rms deviations of each structure versus the reference 
structure (plus a series of columns containing the rotation and translation 
matrices). 
<p>
<h4><a name="section_35">-ref &lt;positive integer&gt;</a></h4>

<p>
This keyword defines the trajectory frame that will be used as reference for 
removing global rotations and translations. It only makes sense in the 
presence of the <strong>-fit</strong>
keyword. 
<p>
<h4><a name="section_36">-index</a></h4>

<p>
If the structure contains flexible parts, you may want to ignore them during 
the least-squares fitting procedure. When this keyword is present, 
<strong>carma</strong>
will attempt to open (from the current directory) a formatted 
ASCII file (text file) with the name <strong>fit.index</strong>
containing the 
<strong>one-based</strong>
indeces of the atoms to be used for least-squares fitting 
(one index number per line). The selection applies after the <strong>-segid</strong>
and <strong>-atomid</strong>
selections have taken place. To make this clear: if 
your original DCD file contains coordinates for 40000 atoms, but you have selected (through 
the <strong>-segid</strong>
and <strong>-atomid</strong>
flags) 5000 atoms, then the 
<strong>fit.index</strong>
file should contain index numbers ranging from 1 to 5000. 
The trajectory file created by the program will contain all selected 
atoms and not just those used for the fitting (referring to the previous example, the 
resulting DCD file will contain coordinates for 5000 atoms (and not just 
those whose indeces were present in the <strong>fit.index</strong>
file)). 
<p>
<h4><a name="section_37">-nofit</a></h4>

<p>
This keyword allows you to calculate the rms deviation between the starting 
(or reference) structure and those that follow, but <strong>without</strong>
least-squares 
superimposing them (before calculating the rmsd). We came across the need 
for such a calculation when studying a homodimer: we run carma once to align 
all frames using one of the monomers, and then used it again (with the -nofit 
keyword) to calculate rms for the other (and using the DCD file produced 
from the first run of carma). 
<p>
<h2><a name="section_38">RMSD matrices</a></h2>

<p>
<h4><a name="section_39">-cross</a></h4>

<p>
This keyword allows you to calculate the rms deviation between all possible 
pairs of structures from your trajectory. The resulting two-dimensional 
matrix will be written in the file <strong>carma.RMSD.matrix</strong>
in the current 
directory. You will need to define a value for the <strong>-step</strong>
flag to 
keep the matrix size manageable. Atom and SEGID selections apply as usual. 
You can produce a colour-postscript representation of the resulting matrix 
again with carma (see the tutorial at the beginning of this document). 
<p>
<h2><a name="section_40">Fraction of native contacts</a></h2>

<p>
<h4><a name="section_41">-Qfract &lt;cutoff&gt; &lt;residue separation&gt;</a></h4>

<p>
Recent versions of carma can calculate native contacts. The assumption is 
that the first frame of the trajectory is the 'native' structure (use, say, 
catdcd to do this), and all calculations are performed with respect to this 
(first) frame. The two numbers after the flag are (i) the distance cutoff 
(in Angstrom) for the contacts, and, (ii) the separation (in number of 
residues) required for a contact. If the second number is 3, then the 
difference in residue numbers must be greater (but not equal) to 3. Carma 
will create a file named <strong>carma.Qfraction.dat</strong>
containing three 
similarity measures. These are Q, Qs and q (in this order) as defined in the 
supplementary information of the Cho, Levy and Wolynes (2005), PNAS, 103, 
586-591 paper (http://www.pnas.org/content/103/3/586) with the difference that for 
the calculation of q the residue separation (given in the command line) is 
being applied. 
<p>
<h2><a name="section_42">Principal Component Analysis (essential dynamics)</a></h2>

<h2><a name="section_43">[1] Cartesian Variance-covariance, average structure, PCA &amp; entropy</a></h2>

<p>
<h4><a name="section_44">-cov</a></h4>

<p>
This signals the calculation of the variance-covariance matrix for the 
coordinates contained in the trajectory file. This keyword must be present 
for any of the cartesian PCA keywords that follow to apply. 
<p>
<h4><a name="section_45">-mass</a></h4>

<p>
Calculate the mass-weighted variance-covariance matrix. The 163 atomic types 
known to the program are (not surpisingly) hard coded (you can find them 
near the top of the source code). Still, if an unknown atomic type is 
encountered, carma will try to grab its mass from the PSF file. 
<p>
<h4><a name="section_46">-dot</a></h4>

<p>
<strong>carma</strong>
will by default calculate the variance-covariance matrix of 
the Cartesian displacements of the individual x,y,z coordinates of all 
selected atoms (CAs by default). This keyword allows you to calculate the 
variance-covariance matrix of the atoms' fluctuations by taking the dot 
product between the displacement vectors. Note that this option is not valid 
when performing the cartesian principal component analysis. A useful 
by-product of this calculation is that a PDB file 
(<strong>carma.average.pdb</strong>)
containing the average structure of all 
selected atoms will be produced. The B-factor column in this PDB file will 
contain the atomic root-mean squared fluctuations (in Angstrom). 
Additionally, a file named <strong>carma.rms-average.dat</strong>
will be produced 
which will contain the rms deviation of each frame from this average 
structure. <strong>Please note</strong>
that the calculation of this rmsd value does 
<strong>not</strong>
involve a least-squares superposition of the average structure 
with the trajectory structures. 
<p>
<h4><a name="section_47">-super</a></h4>

<p>
When calculating the average structure, also prepare a PDB file named 
<strong>carma.superposition.pdb</strong>
which will contain a superposition of 500 
equally spaced structures from the trajectory. The B-factor columns for all 
structures will contain RMSFs. 
<p>
<h4><a name="section_48">-norm</a></h4>

<p>
Instructs the program to output the normalised (cross-correlation) matrix 
instead of the raw variance-covariance matrix. Again, this option is not 
valid when performing the principal component 
analysis. 
<p>
<h4><a name="section_49">-eigen</a></h4>

<p>
If you use the executables provided with the distribution (or if you have 
the LAPACK library to link the program with), <strong>carma</strong>
will 
be able to calculate and write out for you the (sorted) eigenvalues and eigenvectors 
of the raw variance-covariance matrix (but not the cross correlation matrix). 
The results will be written to the files <strong>carma.eigenvectors.dat</strong>
and 
<strong>carma.eigenvalues.dat</strong>.
<p>
<h4><a name="section_50">-proj &lt;integer(1)&gt; &lt;integer(2)&gt; &lt;temp&gt; [&lt;sigma_cutoff&gt;]</a></h4>

<p>
This keyword only applies if both <strong>-cov</strong>
&amp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>-eigen</strong>
have 
been defined. It instructs the program to calculate and output a formatted 
ASCII file (with the name <strong>carma.fluctuations.dat</strong>)
containing the 
top <strong>&lt;integer(1)&gt;</strong>
principal components (projections of the 
fluctuations along the top <strong>&lt;integer(1)&gt;</strong>
eigenvectors). It will 
then prepare DeltaG (free energy landscape) postscript plots for all 
combinations of the top <strong>&lt;integer(2)&gt;</strong>
eigenvectors. In order for 
these plots to have units of kcal/mol, it is necessary to define the 
temperature for the simulation <strong>&lt;temp&gt;</strong>.
The postscript files 
produced will be named carma.PCA.DG_01_02.ps, carma.PCA.DG_01_03.ps, ..., 
depending on the vectors used for them. Finally (and if the second argument 
&lt;integer(2)&gt; is greater than 2), the program will perform a 
simple-minded cluster analysis on the space defined by the three 
eigenvectors corresponding to the three largest eigenvalues. The results 
from this calculation are placed in a file named <strong>carma.clusters.dat</strong>
and are discussed in the section entitled <strong>PCA-based cluster analysis</strong>.
The last optional argument <strong>&lt;sigma_cutoff&gt;</strong>
determines 
a cutoff for the cluster determination procedure. By default its value is 
determined automatically, and is discussed in the section <strong>PCA-based cluster analysis</strong>.
<p>
<h4><a name="section_51">-out &lt;first&gt; &lt;last&gt; &lt;step&gt;</a></h4>

<p>
This keyword only applies if both <strong>-cov</strong>
&amp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>-eigen</strong>
have been 
defined. It instructs the program to output a DCD file with the name 
<strong>carma.proj.dcd</strong>
which contains the projection of the input 
trajectory on the specified eigenvectors. 
<p>
<h4><a name="section_52">-play &lt;eigenvector&gt; &lt;max amplitude&gt; &lt;min amplitude&gt;</a></h4>

<p>
This keyword only applies if both <strong>-cov</strong>
&amp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>-eigen</strong>
have been 
defined. It instructs the program to output a DCD file with the name 
<strong>carma.play.dcd</strong>
which contains a smooth representation of the 
motion due to one (selected) eigenvector. The maximum and minimum amplitudes 
of the fluctuations along this eigenvector must also be specified and these 
usually come from a previous run of the program with the <strong>-proj</strong>
flag. 
<p>
<h4><a name="section_53">-artificial &lt;vectors&gt; &lt;frames&gt;</a></h4>

<p>
This keyword only applies if both <strong>-cov</strong>
&amp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>-eigen</strong>
have 
been defined. With this keyword <strong>carma</strong>
can be used to produce a DCD 
file (with the name <strong>carma.arti.dcd</strong>)
containing a set of structures 
that are derivable from a set of eigenvectors and eigenvalues (obtained from 
a principal component analysis of the given trajectory). To perform the 
calculation the program needs the fluctuations contained in the file 
<strong>carma.fluctuations.dat</strong>
(assumed to be present in the current 
directory from a previous run of the program with the flag <strong>-proj</strong>).
To make things clear : if you want to prepare a set of 10000 structures 
derivable from the first 30 eigenvactors, you should run <strong>carma</strong>
twice : the first time including the flag <strong>-proj 1 30 1</strong>,
the second 
time including the flag <strong>-arti 30 10000</strong>.
<p>
<h4><a name="section_54">-use</a></h4>

<p>
This flag instructs the program to read previously calculated eigenvalues 
and eigenvectors instead of re-calculating them. These will be read from the 
files <strong>carma.eigenvectors.dat</strong>
and <strong>carma.eigenvalues.dat</strong>
which must be present in the current directory. Using previously calculated 
values does lead to some loss of precision (due to the format of these ASCII 
files), but for large problems (where the eigen-calculations are the 
heaviest part of the calculation) it may be the preferred choice. For a note 
on the precision and accuracy aspects of the eigen-calculation see the 
<strong>Bugs</strong>
section below. 
<p>
<h4><a name="section_55">-temperature &lt;float&gt;</a></h4>

<p>
The presence of the <strong>-temp</strong>
flag (followed by the temperature in 
Kelvin that the simulation was performed) instructs the program to calculate 
the solute's entropy using the eigenvalues of the mass-weighted 
variance-covariance matrix. The presence of the -cov, -eigen and -mass flags 
is required. The entropy is calculated using two different formulas 
(reported in the program output). For the calculation to be meaningful, you 
should select all solute atoms (and not just the default CAs). Also note 
that the entropy value returned by the program (in J/molK) assumes that your 
trajectory file contains coordinates for only one copy of the molecule of 
interest. If this is not true, you will have to divide the entropy value 
returned by carma with the number of molecules. 
<p>
<h4><a name="section_56">-3d</a></h4>

<p>
When this flag is present, carma will produce two additional files named 
<strong>carma.3d_landscape.cns</strong>
and <strong>carma.3d_landscape.na4</strong>.
These 
are three-dimensional map files containing the distribution of the top three 
principal components, which may be viewed as three-dimensional folding 
landscapes. The <strong>carma.3d_landscape.cns</strong>
can be loaded and viewed 
directly with VMD (you will have to adjust the cutoff for the various 
isosurfaces). The <strong>carma.3d_landscape.na4</strong>
is for use with the CCP4 
suite of programs. 
<p>
<h2><a name="section_57">Principal Component Analysis (essential dynamics)</a></h2>

<h2><a name="section_58">[2] Dihedral angle (phi-psi) variance-covariance &amp; PCA</a></h2>

<p>
<h4><a name="section_59">-dPCA &lt;integer(1)&gt; &lt;integer(2)&gt; &lt;temp&gt; [&lt;sigma_cutoff&gt;]</a></h4>

<p>
This flag signals the beginning of the dihedral PCA (dPCA) analysis. For 
this to work you will have to use the <strong>-segid</strong>
flag to define at 
least one protein chain that will be used for the analysis. The program will 
automatically select all necessary main-chain atoms, will build a list of 
psi-phi angles that will be used for the analysis, will calculate the 
variance-covariance matrix (file my.dcd.dPCA.varcov.ps), and calculate its 
eigenvectors and eigenvalues (which will be written-out in the files 
carma.dPCA.eigenvalues.dat and carma.dPCA.eigenvectors.dat). It will then 
prepare a file named <strong>carma.dPCA.fluctuations.dat</strong>
containing the top 
<strong>&lt;integer(1)&gt;</strong>
principal components (projections of the 
fluctuations along the top <strong>&lt;integer(1)&gt;</strong>
eigenvectors). It will 
then prepare DeltaG (free energy landscape) postscript plots for all 
combinations of the top <strong>&lt;integer(2)&gt;</strong>
eigenvectors. In order for 
these plots to have units of kcal/mol, it is necessary to define the 
temperature for the simulation <strong>&lt;temp&gt;</strong>.
The postscript files 
produced will be named carma.dPCA.DG_01_02.ps, carma.dPCA.DG_01_03.ps, ..., 
depending on the vectors used for them. Finally (and if the second argument 
&lt;integer(2)&gt; is greater than 2), the program will perform a 
simple-minded cluster analysis on the space defined by the three 
eigenvectors corresponding to the three largest eigenvalues. The results 
from this calculation are placed in a file named <strong>carma.clusters.dat</strong>
and are discussed in the section entitled <strong>PCA-based cluster analysis</strong>.
The last optional argument <strong>&lt;sigma_cutoff&gt;</strong>
determines 
a cutoff for the cluster determination procedure. By default its value is 
determined automatically, and is discussed in the section <strong>PCA-based cluster analysis</strong>.
<p>
<h4><a name="section_60">-chi1</a></h4>

<p>
This flag tells carma to include in the dihedral PCA analysis the 
side-chains' chi1 angles. The program will report the number of phi, psi and 
chi1 angles used for the analysis. Carma has fixed ideas about the names of 
the atoms needed to define all required angles and will fail if the atoms 
with names N, CA, C, CG, CG1, OG, OG1, SG and CB do not suffice for defining 
the required angles. 
<p>
<h2><a name="section_61">Ion &amp; water distribution maps</a></h2>

<p>
<h4><a name="section_62">-map &lt;float(1)&gt; ... &lt;float(7)&gt;</a></h4>

<p>
This keyword allows the calculation of an average distribution map (of 
waters, ions, ...) during the trajectory. The map is written in a file named 
<strong>carma.fitted.dcd.map</strong>
using the <strong>xplor</strong>
and <strong>cns</strong>
electron density map format (it may be necessary to rename the map file so 
that its suffix is .edm). The first six numbers after the flag are the 
limits (in the orthogonal frame and in Angstrom) along x, y and z that the 
map will occupy. The last number is the grid spacing (again in Angstrom). 
The distribution map will be calculated for all selected atoms. A typical 
usage would be : 
<p>
carma -v -map -30 30 -20 20 -15 20 0.50 -atmid OH2 wat_ions.psf wat_ions.dcd 
<p>
<strong>Please do note the following</strong>
: 
<p>
*&nbsp;&nbsp;The method will fail if the solute diffused away from the water 
box. The reason for this is that the periodic boundary periodicity is not 
being taken into account. 
<p>
*&nbsp;&nbsp;The method will fail if the solute does not have a well behaved 
average structure. 
<p>
*&nbsp;&nbsp;The calculation assumes that your DCD file is such that 
rotations and translations have been removed from the solute (but, of 
course, the atomic species for which you want to calculate the distribution 
map must still be present in the trajectory). You can do the trick using 
<strong>carma</strong>
with something in the spirit of 
<p>
<pre>
carma -v -fit -index -atmid OH2 -atmid SOD -atmid CLA -atmid CA my.dcd my.psf
</pre>
<p>
where the fit.index file (which should be present in the current directory) 
should contain (the one-based) indeces for the CA atoms (after the 
selection imposed by the -atmid cards). 
<p>
<h4><a name="section_63">-fmap &lt;float(1)&gt; ... &lt;float(7)&gt;</a></h4>

<p>
The problem with the <strong>-map</strong>
flag is that it necessitates the creation 
of a large intermediate trajectory file. The <strong>-fmap</strong>
flag attempts to 
speed things-up by calculating the distribution map on the fly. The meaning 
of the seven parameters following <strong>-fmap</strong>
are the same as with the 
<strong>-map</strong>
flag. The difference is that <strong>-fmap</strong>
must be used 
simultaneously with the <strong>-fit</strong>
and <strong>-index</strong>
flags and requires the 
creation of two index files. The first (file <strong>fit.index</strong>)
will contain 
the indeces for the solute atoms that will be used to remove overall 
rotations and translations. The second index file (<strong>fmap.index</strong>)
should 
contain the indeces of the atoms for which the distribution map will be 
calculated (eg. water oxygens). Both index files should be one-offset (the 
first atom has index 1 and not 0). Once you have the index files, use the 
program with something in the spirit of : 
<p>
carma -v -fit -index -atmid OH2 -atmid CA -fmap -30 30 -20 20 -15 20 0.50 my.psf my.dcd 
<p>
Please note that the indeces (in the index files) should refer to atom 
indeces <strong>following</strong>
all selections based on <strong>-atmid</strong>
and 
<strong>-segid</strong>
cards. To make this clear: lets say that your original DCD 
file contains 40000 atoms, of which 3000 are solute atoms (with 300 CA 
atoms), 36999 are water atoms, and there is one sodium ion. If you select 
only the OH2 and CA atoms (as in the previous example), then <strong>carma</strong>
will only "see" 12633 atoms (300 CA atoms plus (36999/3)=12333 OH2 atoms). 
The two index files should contain numbers (indeces) ranging from 1 to 
12633. Most probably, you would want to prepare a <strong>fit.index</strong>
file containing the 
numbers from 1 to 300 (which would tell carma to remove 
rotations/translations using the CA atoms), and a <strong>fmap.index</strong>
file 
containing numbers from 301 to 12633 (which would tell carma to calculate a 
density distribution map for water oxygens). 
<p>
<strong>Please also note the following</strong>
: 
<p>
*&nbsp;&nbsp;The method will fail if the solute diffused away from the water 
box. The reason for this is that the periodic boundary periodicity is not 
being taken into account. 
<p>
*&nbsp;&nbsp;The method will fail if the solute does not have a well behaved 
average structure.

<h2><a name="section_64">Radius of gyration, molecular surface area, distances &amp; torsions</a></h2>

<p>
<h4><a name="section_65">-Rg</a></h4>

<p>
This will calculate the mass-weighted radius of gyration of the selected 
atoms. To use this flag, you must also define at least one chain (with the 
<strong>-segid</strong>
flag) for which the calculation will be performed. Because carma's 
default is to use only the CA atoms, you most probably also need a 
<strong>-atmid HEAVY</strong>
or <strong>-atmid ALLID</strong>
flag.

<h4><a name="section_66">-distance [&lt;Atom1&gt; &lt;Atom2&gt;] | [file name]</a></h4>

The <strong>-distance</strong>
flag is followed by two integers which correspond to 
the indeces of two atoms whose distance the program will calculate (as a 
function of frame number). If you want to calculate many distances 
simultaneously, you can feed a file containing the atomic indeces. 
The atomic indeces are one-based, and if you use 
the <strong>-atmid ALLID</strong>
flag to select all atoms, then the numbers you 
want are the atom numbers as contained in the PSF file. To make this clear: 
if you run the program by saying 
<div align=center>
<pre>
carma -v -dist 1 2 my.dcd my.psf
</pre>
</div>
then, <strong>carma</strong>
will calculate the distance between the first 
<strong>CA atom</strong>
and the second <strong>CA</strong>
atom. The reason is that the program's default is to only 
use the CA atoms. The way to avoid complications is to say 
<div align=center>
<pre>
carma -v -atmid ALLID -dist 13 28 my.dcd my.psf
</pre>
</div>
which will calculate the distance between the 13th atom declared in the PSF 
file (whichever this atom may be), and the 28th. The results will 
be written in a file named <strong>carma.distances</strong>
in the current directory. 
<p>
<h4><a name="section_67">-torsion [&lt;Atom1&gt; ... &lt;Atom4&gt;] | [file name]</a></h4>

<p>
The <strong>-torsion</strong>
flag instructs the program to calculate the torsion 
angle between the four atoms whose indeces follow the card. If you want to 
calculate many torsions simultaneously, you can feed a file containing 
tetraplets of atom indeces. Please see the description of the 
<strong>-distance</strong>
flag (above) for a clarification concerning atom 
selections. The results will be written in a file named 
<strong>carma.torsions</strong>
in the current directory. With the wide-spread 
confusion between dihedral and torsion angles, you are better-off confirming 
that the numbers you get from <strong>carma</strong>
indeed correspond to what you 
want to calculate. 
<p>
<h4><a name="section_68">-bend &lt;Atom1&gt; ... &lt;Atom3&gt;</a></h4>

<p>
The <strong>-bend</strong>
flag instructs the program to calculate the bending angle 
between the three atoms whose indices follow the card. Again, see the 
description of the <strong>-distance</strong>
flag (above) for a clarification 
concerning atom selections. The results will be written in a file named 
<strong>carma.bendangles</strong>
in the current directory. 
<p>
<h4><a name="section_69">-surface</a></h4>

<p>
When this flag is present, the program will calculate a metric related to 
the total surface area of the atoms selected. To avoid misunderstandings and 
flames: 
<p>
<div align=center>
<strong>This is NOT an accessible surface area,</strong>
<strong>NOR a properly calculated total molecular surface area</strong>.
</div>
<p>
Now that this is clear, let me describe in some detail what carma actually 
calculates: Start by preparing a grid enclosing the molecule of interest 
using a 0.4 Angstrom distance between successive grid points. Then, set 
all grid points that are less than 3.2 Angstrom from any atom to a value of 
1, everything else to zero (ie. make a fat molecular mask). Count the number 
of grid points that have a value of 1 and at least one of their closest 
neighbors is a zero. This is the number of grid points that form the surface 
of the mask. Multiply this number with a constant and this is what you get 
in the file <strong>carma.surface.dat</strong>.
The constant has been chosen so that 
the numbers you get are approximately on the same scale as the values of the 
surface area (in Angstrom squared). In summary, what you get is 
essentially the number of 'pixels' making-up a mask around your molecule. 
Although the numbers per se are neither ASA nor SA, I do hope that 
their <strong>relative</strong>
long-range changes for the length of the trajectory are 
representative of what happens with the total surface area, especially if 
you use this flag to calculate differences (corresponding to buried 
surfaces). Needless to say that if you use this flag to follow changes in 
the buried surface area of an oligomer, you should not even think about 
converting them to DeltaG. 
<p>
<h2><a name="section_70">Average and rmsd (from average) distance maps</a></h2>

<p>
<h4><a name="section_71">-rms</a></h4>

<p>
In this mode <strong>carma</strong>
will produce two postscript files : The first 
(of the form <strong>my.dcd.averag.ps</strong>)
will contain a map of the average values of all 
CA-CA distances for all frames contained in the DCD file. The second file 
(of the form <strong>my.dcd.rmsdev.ps</strong>)
will contain the corresponding root-mean-square 
deviations from the aforementioned averages. The contrast of the image 
contained in this second file is reversed (the higher the RMSD, the darker 
the image). 
<p>
<h4><a name="section_72">-mrms &lt;float&gt;</a></h4>

<p>
This keyword allows you to adjust the maximum value of the RMSD map that 
will be plotted. All values greater than <strong>mrms</strong>
will appear black in 
the final postscript image. 
<p>
<h2><a name="section_73">Running stride to calculate secondary structure assignments</a></h2>

<p>
<h4><a name="section_74">-stride</a></h4>

<p>
If you are on the unix machine, and if the executable for stride is present 
and in your path (say 'stride' from the unix shell to check) you can ask 
carma to automatically produce a file containing the stride-derived 
secondary structure assignments. The way to do that is to use simultaneously 
the '-pdb -stride' flags in which case instead of producing PDB files, carma 
will pass them to 'stride' for the assignments' calculation. The results 
will be found in a file named <strong>carma.stride.dat</strong>
in the current 
directory (one line per trajectory frame). 
<p>
If you have VMD installed, then you already have stride, but with a 
different name and at a directory that most probably than not, is not in 
your path. You'll need something like 
'sudo /bin/cp /usr/local/lib/vmd/stride_LINUX /usr/local/bin/stride' to 
make copy it (with a suitable name) in /usr/local/bin. 
<p>
<h2><a name="section_75">Postscript things</a></h2>

<p>
<h4><a name="section_76">-colour [15 x &lt;float&gt;]</a></h4>

<p>
If the <strong>-colour</strong>
flag is present in the command line, then instead of 
the default linear grayscale postscript, <strong>carma</strong>
will emit colour 
postscript. If you try it and end-up believing that the author 
is colour-blind, then read-on: It is possible to define your own colour 
gradient by adding exactly 15 (!) numbers (all between 0.0 and 1.0) after 
the flag. These 15 numbers are the Red-Green-Blue components of your 
colour gradient at five points: at your data's minimum, at one quarter, at half, 
at three-quarters, and at maximum. The program's default can be found in the 
source code (search for RED_1), and goes from dark blue (for small values), 
through yellow (for intermediate values), to dark red (for large values). 
<p>
<h4><a name="section_77">-min &lt;float&gt;</a></h4>

<p>
The linear grayscale (or colour) gradient of the CA-CA distance maps will start at the 
specified distance. All distances shorter than this will appear black 
in the postscript image. This keyword also defines the smallest visible 
value in the case of variance-covariance calculations and when using the 
program as a filter. 
<p>
<h4><a name="section_78">-max &lt;float&gt;</a></h4>

<p>
The linear grayscale (or colour) gradient of the CA-CA distance maps will stop at the 
specified distance. All distances longer than this will appear white 
in the postscript image. This keyword also defines the largest visible 
value in the case of variance-covariance calculations and when using the 
program as a filter. 
<p>
<h4><a name="section_79">-reverse</a></h4>

<p>
This flag will reverse the contrast of the postscript plots produced by the 
program. 
<p>
<h2><a name="section_80">PCA-based free energy landscapes</a></h2>

<p>
The DeltaG plots are obtained from the equation DeltaG = -kB T ln[P/Pmax] 
where kB is Boltzmann's constant, T is the temperature in Kelvin, and P and 
Pmax are probabilities obtained from the distribution of the principal 
components for each structure (frame) from the trajectory. By dividing with 
Pmax, the minimum DeltaG is zero at the configuration corresponding to Pmax. 
To keep the colour gradient as linear as possible within the range of 
interest, <strong>carma</strong>
assigns the value of Pmin to all zero-valued parts 
of the probability distribution, where Pmin is the lowest non-zero P 
observed. 
<p>
If you want to convince <strong>carma</strong>
to produce graphs with a fixed scale, 
use the keyword <strong>-DGwidth &lt;float&gt;</strong>
where <strong>&lt;float&gt;</strong>
is the 
length in Angstrom of the edge of the graphs (if, for example, you want all 
your DeltaG plots to range from -20 Angstrom to +20 Angstrom, then add the 
flag <strong>-DGwidth 40</strong>.
<p>
<h2><a name="section_81">PCA-based cluster analysis</a></h2>

<p>
If the flags <strong>-proj</strong>
or <strong>-dPCA</strong>
are used and their second 
argument is greater than 2, carma will automatically perform an analysis of 
the three largest principal components with the aim of identifying prominent 
molecular configurations corresponding to heavily populated clusters in the 
three-dimensional principal component space (see below for a detailed 
description of what the program does). The results from this 
calculation are placed in a file name <strong>carma.clusters.dat</strong>
whose 
structure will look similar to this: 
<p>
<pre>
       1   1   -0.9946293    0.5751649   -0.3420320
       3   1   -1.0408418    0.6531497   -0.2453037
      .............................................
     785   3   -0.4106219   -0.6585305   -0.5737749
     786   3   -0.3866465   -0.7197343   -0.3226163
      .............................................
</pre>
<p>
The first column is the frame number from the DCD file, the second column is 
the cluster identifier. Cluster number 1 is the cluster with the highest 
density (not neccessarily the most populated cluster, see below), number 2 
the one with the second highest density, etc. The rest of the columns are 
the values of the three largest principal components for the corresponding 
frames. The reason that these are included is to allow you to check visually 
what the program did by comparing the distribution from the file 
<strong>carma.dPCA.fluctuations.dat</strong>
(or 
<strong>carma.PCA.fluctuations.dat</strong>)
with the distributions obtained if only 
frames from a specific cluster are used (see the <strong>I hate manuals</strong>
tutorial above). 
<p>
<strong>What carma does:</strong>
For each trajectory frame calculate the values V1, 
V2, V3 of the three largest principal components. Use these values to 
populate a three dimensional map describing the distribution of these values 
(the higher the value at a grid point of the map, the larger the number of 
frames with V1-V2-V3 values closest to this grid point). This map can be 
viewed with VMD if you pass carma the the <strong>-3d</strong>
flag. At the next 
stage the program attempts to identify all isolated 'peaks' in this 
distribution map, corresponding to heavily populated clusters. The rmsd 
cutoff for identifying isolated peaks is determined automatically by 
examining the fraction of 'variance explained' as a function of the number 
of clusters (the file <strong>carma.variance_explained.dat</strong>
contains the 
results from this calculation). The automatically-determined cutoff can be 
changed by passing an optional fourth argument to <strong>-proj</strong>
or 
<strong>-dPCA</strong>.
Now that the clusters have been identified, carma goes back 
and determines which trajectory frames belong to which cluster. The results 
are written to the file <strong>carma.clusters.dat</strong>
described above. 
<p>
<strong>Limitations:</strong>
(1) If the distribution map is not sufficiently 
sampled, or if the degrees of freedom are too few, the map may not have the 
'peaky' appearance assumed by the procedure described above (you can see 
whether this is the case by examining the DeltaG plots produced by the 
program). (2) The procedure does not even try to assign each and every frame 
to a cluster. Depending on the morphology of the distribution map, a 
significant percentage of trajectory frames will remain unassigned. For this 
reason the clustering procedure may not be useful for determining 
transitions and average lifetimes of conformations. 
<p>
<h2><a name="section_82">Graphics tricks and examples</a></h2>

<p>
<strong>Carma</strong>
can do a few primitive tricks with graphics. If you have 
a graphics-enabled executable, try giving 
<p>
<div align=center>
<strong>carma my.psf my.dcd</strong>
</div>
<p>
You should be asked for the number of the first frame to display. Just hit 
enter and you should see it. 
<p>
While viewing the trajectory, use the keys 'x', 'y', and 'z' to select 
orthogonal view. Press the 'P' key to pause. Change the zoom with the '&lt;' 
and '&gt;' keys. Press 'S' to enter stereo (side-by-side) mode. Press the 'ESC' 
key to swing it (or to stop swinging it). Use the arrow keys to navigate. 
Press 'R' to reset translations. Press 'P' to exit pause mode (and continue 
viewing the trajectory). You can change the step (stride) by pressing the 
'+' and '-' keys. 
<p>
You can use the <strong>-segid</strong>
and <strong>-atomid</strong>
flags to change which 
atoms are displayed (and how they are coloured). See section on graphics 
keywords. 
<p>
Note, that if you have an executable with graphics support, you can always 
switch-on the graphics (with something like <strong>-gl 100 -trace</strong>)
irrespectively of what else you asked carma to do. Waiting for 
<strong>carma</strong>
to finish will never be the same. 
<p>
Since version 0.8, the program understands DCD files containing unit cell 
dimensions (for a PBC simulation). Additionally, it can produce a very 
primitive graphical representation of a volume containing 2x2x2 cells (press 
'B' while viewing the trajectory). 
<p>
In the examples that follow the number next to the '-gl' flag corresponds to 
the size of the edge the graphics window in Angstrom.

<h2><a name="section_83">Other uses</a></h2>

<p>
<h4><a name="section_84">Using carma as a unix filter</a></h4>

<p>
If you have a square matrix of reals <strong>carma</strong>
will happily read it in 
and write out a postscript file with the name <strong>carma.stdin.ps</strong>
containing a grayscale image of your data. 
The way to do that is simply <strong>carma - &lt; myfile.dat</strong>.
If you also want 
to adjust the contrast of the image, give <strong>carma -min ??? -max ??? - &lt; myfile.dat</strong>.
If you also want your matrix formatted by carma, 
<strong>carma -write -min ??? -max ??? - &lt; myfile.dat</strong>
should do the trick. 
<p>
<h4><a name="section_85">Merging postscript images</a></h4>

<p>
Executing <strong>carma</strong>
with only arguments the names of two postscript files 
of same dimension (and produced by the program during previous runs) will 
give you a new postscript file with the name <strong>carma.merged.ps</strong>
containing the (above the diagonal) half from the first image, and the other 
(below the diagonal) half from the second. 
<p>
<h4><a name="section_86">Re-ordering DCD frames</a></h4>

<p>
Executing <strong>carma</strong>
with the <strong>-sort &lt;my.order&gt; my.dcd</strong>
arguments, will allow you to re-order the frames in the DCD file to match 
the order contained in the file <strong>&lt;my.order&gt;</strong>.
The <strong>my.order</strong>
file is an ASCII file 
which contains one frame number per line. The output DCD file will be 
<strong>carma.reordered.dcd</strong>
and will contain the defined frames with the 
order given in the <strong>&lt;my.order&gt;</strong>
file. 
<p>
<h2><a name="section_87">Short examples</a></h2>

<p>
<h2><a name="section_88">A longer example</a></h2>

<p>
We start with four files : <strong>my.dcd</strong>
and <strong>my.psf</strong>
are from 
your MD run, <strong>my_CAs.psf</strong>
is the PSF corresponding to the CA atoms 
only, <strong>my_AB_CAs.psf</strong>
is the PSF corresponding to the CA atoms of the 
segments "A&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"&nbsp;&nbsp;and "B&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"&nbsp;&nbsp;of your structure (you can use VMD or X-PLOR to 
produce these). 
<p>
Start by removing any global rotations/translations of the whole molecule 
(and considering only CAs) : 
<p>
<strong>carma -verb -fit my.dcd my.psf</strong>
<p>
<strong>mv carma.fitted.dcd fitted_whole.dcd</strong>
<p>
<strong>mv carma.fit-rms.dat rms_whole.dat</strong>
<p>
Repeat the procedure, but this time using only segments A and B : 
<p>
<strong>carma -verb -fit -segid " A&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"&nbsp;&nbsp;-segid " B&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"&nbsp;&nbsp;my.dcd my.psf</strong>
<p>
<strong>mv carma.fitted.dcd fitted_AB.dcd</strong>
<p>
<strong>mv carma.fit-rms.dat rms_AB.dat</strong>

<strong>xmgr rms_whole.dat rms_AB.dat</strong>).
<p>
Calculate the average CA-CA distance maps and their corresponding rms deviations

<strong>carma -verb -max 15.0 -mrms 2.0 my_CAs.psf fitted_whole.dcd</strong>
<p>
<strong>mv fitted_whole.dcd.averag.ps whole.averag.ps</strong>
<p>
<strong>mv fitted_whole.dcd.rmsdev.ps whole.rmsdev.ps</strong>
<p>
<strong>carma -verb -max 15.0 -mrms 2.0 my_AB_CAs.psf fitted_AB.dcd</strong>

<strong>mv fitted_AB.dcd.averag.ps AB.averag.ps</strong>
<p>
<strong>mv fitted_AB.dcd.rmsdev.ps AB.rmsdev.ps</strong>
<p>
<strong>gv whole.rmsdev.ps</strong>
<p>
<strong>gv AB.rmsdev.ps</strong>
<p>
Calculate the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the Cartesian (x,y,z) 
fluctuations of the CA atoms' variance-covariance matrix but only 
considering the C-D segments (note that because we are not producing a DCD 
file, we do not need a PSF file just for segments C-D) : 
<p>
<strong>carma -verb -segid " C&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"&nbsp;&nbsp;-segid " D&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"&nbsp;&nbsp;-write -cov -eigen my.psf my.dcd</strong>
<p>
Now, lets make a movie depicting the motion of the whole molecule 
(considering CAs only) due the eigenvector corresponding to the largest 
eigenvalue : 
<p>
<strong>carma -verb -write -cov -eigen -proj 2 2 300 my.psf my.dcd</strong>
<p>
<strong>echo "Amplitude limits are " `sort -r -n -k 2 carma.fluctuations.dat | tail -1 | awk '{print $2}'` `sort -n -k 2 carma.fluctuations.dat | tail -1 | awk '{print $2}'`</strong>
<p>
<strong>carma -verb -write -cov -eigen -play 1 &lt;amp1&gt; &lt;amp2&gt; my.psf my.dcd</strong>
<p>
<strong>vmd my_CAs.psf carma.play.dcd</strong>
<p>
where <strong>&lt;amp1&gt;</strong>
and <strong>&lt;amp2&gt;</strong>
are the values returned by the 
echo command line. 
<p>
<h2><a name="section_89">Appendix: Preparation of CA-only PSF files</a></h2>

<p>
<strong>Carma</strong>
can only process "paired" DCD and PSF files: if a DCD file 
only contains CA atoms, you need a PSF file containing only CA atoms. If 
your DCD file contains only 'HEAVY' atoms, you need a PSF file containing 
only non-hydrogen atoms. 
<p>
The easiest way to prepare such PSF files is through carma itself : when the 
'-w' flag is being used, then carma will prepare a pseudo-PSF (suitable only 
for usage with carma) with the name <strong>carma.selected_atoms.psf</strong>
which 
will contain information for the selected atoms. If, for example, you say 
'carma -v -w -fit all_atoms.dcd all_atoms.psf' then carma will produce a 
CA-only DCD file plus a pseudo-PSF file which you can then rename to more 
suitable names : 
<p>
<pre>
mv carma.fitted.dcd CAs_fitted.dcd
mv carma.selected_atoms.psf CAs.psf
</pre>
<p>
You can also prepare such PSF files using X-PLOR or VMD. If you are an X-PLOR user, 
the following script will suffice (protein.psf is the complete PSF file of 
your protein as produced, for example, from PSFGEN): 
<p>
<pre>
_______________________________________________

structure @protein.psf end
delete selection=( not (name ca)) end
write structure output=CAs.psf end
stop
_______________________________________________
</pre>
<p>
If you'd rather use VMD, here is the script (protein.pdb and protein.psf are 
the PDB and PSF files as produced, for example, from PSFGEN): 
<p>
<pre>
_______________________________________________

mol load pdb protein.pdb
mol load psf protein.psf
set sel [atomselect 0 "backbone and name CA" ]
$sel writepsf CAs.psf
_______________________________________________
</pre>
<p>
Slight modification of these scripts can allow you to prepare PSF files for 
various atom combinations, for example, all non-hydrogen protein atoms. 
<p>
<h2><a name="section_90">Bugs &amp; features</a></h2>

<p>
*&nbsp;&nbsp;The documentation is hell. 
<p>
*&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>carma</strong>'s
sanity checks on input are rudimentary. It 
should be relatively easy to dump core with random combinations of keywords 
and parameters. 
<p>
*&nbsp;&nbsp;The PDB files written by <strong>carma</strong>
use only three 
characters for atom names and only one character for the chain identifier. 
For example, HG21, HG22, HG23 will all be written to the PDB file as HG2, 
and segids WT1, WT2, ..., will all take the chain identifier 'W'. 
<p>
*&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>carma</strong>
is known to process correctly PSF and DCD files written by 
X-PLOR and NAMD, but may give <strong>wrong</strong>
results with CHARMM DCD files if 
these contain additional CHARMM-specific blocks within the coordinate sets. 
<strong>carma</strong>
does check for the presence of CHARMM-specific flags in the header 
block and if found it will abort the calculation. Still, better safe than sorry : 
<p>
<div align=center>
<strong>Using this program with CHARMM-type DCD files may under certain circumstances give you wrong results</strong>
</div>
<p>
*&nbsp;&nbsp;When <strong>carma</strong>
calculates fluctuations for dihedral PCA, it 
subtracts the average sin/cos values. This is different from the original 
dPCA papers by the Stock group. This corresponds to a shift of origin for 
the PCs and does not affect the analysis. Thanks to Jerome Henin for 
pointing this out. 
<p>
*&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>carma</strong>
takes a rather cavalier approach with its input files, 
just trying to get to the needed coordinates as quickly as possible ignoring 
most of the structure of these files. The result is that the program may not 
perform as expected in hypothetical cases where this additional structure 
ought to have been interpreted.

is using single precision eigenroutines (whether 
LAPACK's or numerical recipes'). The implication is that the resulting 
eigenvalues and eigenvectors are of limited accuracy. To clarify this point, 
the following table shows the relative (per-cent) discrepancy 
<p>
<div align=center>
100 * SUM_i | L1(i) - L2(i) | / SUM_i [0.5*((L1(i)+L2(i))] 
</div>
<p>
between the eigenvalues of a 551 by 551 Wilkinson matrix as calculated from 
executables produced by two 
different compilers and two different eigenroutine libraries on a linux machine :

<div align=center>

Since for a Wilkinson matrix the eigenvalues should be equal in pairs (to at 
least 12 digits), it is also possible to access the internal reliability of 
the results by calculating 
<p>
<div align=center>
100 * SUM | L(i) - L(i+1) | / SUM [0.5*(L(i)+L(i+1))] 
</div>
<p>
where the sums are taken (in pairs) over the 200 largest eigenvalues : 
<p>
<div align=center>
<table>
<tr>
<td>gcc_LA </td>
<td> gcc_NR </td>
<td> intel_LA </td>
<td> intel_NR </td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>0.000039 </td>
<td> 0.000102 </td>
<td> 0.000078 </td>
<td> 0.000092 </td>
</tr>
 
</table>
</div>
<p>
The different behaviour of the LAPACK routines with the two compilers is 
probably due to the greedy optimisation flags that I have used while making 
the LAPACK library with the Intel compilers.
